# Branding Images

Matthew's ATS can display branding by linking to the relevant resources via URL.

They __are not__ bundled into the application. Upload them to your Azure Storage Account's `$web` folder, serving them statically, and add the URLs to the appropriate App Config entry / appsettings.json file for the element you wish to brand.
